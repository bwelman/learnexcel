Excel is part of the Microsoft Office suite. It allows you to perform calculations in spreadsheets. This chapter provides an introduction to spreadsheets in general, with a specific focus on Excel.

## What is Excel? {#sec-intro-over}

A spreadsheet is a computer program that lets you enter data (text, numbers, etc.) into sheets made up of rows and columns. Besides entering data, you can also perform various operations on it. Microsoft Excel is one such program.

The term "spreadsheet" is also used to refer to a file created with such a program. In Excel, this file is called a **workbook**. The standard file format is `.xlsx`, but Excel supports many other formats for both reading and saving files.

A workbook can contain one or more **worksheets**. A worksheet is divided into rows and columns, and their intersections are called **cells**. Cells are identified by a column letter and a row number — for example, B3 refers to the cell in column B, row 3.

You can enter text, numbers, and formulas in cells. Formulas allow you to perform calculations or manipulate text. They can reference other cells, making it possible to build large and complex calculation models. Any change will automatically update all dependent values.

Spreadsheets are very useful for performing [What-if analysis]{.term}, where you modify input values to see how they affect results. Excel also makes it easy to create clear and attractive charts.

## Starting and Closing Excel {#sec-intro-excel-start}

How you start Excel depends on your system setup. This course assumes a default installation of Microsoft Office 365 on Windows 10. On most systems, Excel can be launched from the Start menu. The easiest way is to use a shortcut on the desktop or taskbar.

::: {#prp-intro-start-excel}
1.  Choose [Start \> Excel]{.uicontrol}.

The Excel start screen appears. On the left, you’ll see recently opened files; on the right, an overview of available templates.

2.  Click on the [Blank workbook]{.uicontrol} template. A new workbook opens named [Book1]{.varname} with a blank worksheet named [Sheet1]{.varname}.

::: callout-note
**Disabling the Start Screen**

By default, Excel shows the start screen at launch. This includes recent documents and templates. If preferred, you can start Excel with a blank workbook:

Go to [File \> Options \> General tab]{.uicontrol} and uncheck the option [Show the Start screen when this application starts]{.uicontrol}.

Next time you launch Excel, it will open directly to a new workbook.
:::

To exit Excel:

-   Click the [X]{.uicontrol} button in the top right corner of the window.
-   Or choose [File \> Close]{.uicontrol} from the menu.

3.  Close Excel.

::: callout-note
If changes were made to the workbook, Excel will prompt you to save them before closing.

## The Excel Window {#sec-intro-excel-window}

The Excel interface includes three main areas: the application controls, the worksheet, and the status bar. These are shown top to bottom in the image below.

![Excel interface.](images/common/excel-window.png){#fig-excel-window}

1 - File

:   Opens a menu with basic commands such as New, Open, Save, Print, and Options. This view is known as the **Backstage**.

-   ![](images/common/button-form.png) [Form]{.uicontrol}

3 - Ribbon

:   A wide toolbar at the top. Commands are grouped under tabs like [Home]{.uicontrol}, [Insert]{.uicontrol}, [Page Layout]{.uicontrol}, ....

Some tabs, such as contextual tabs (e.g., **Chart Tools**), only appear when relevant. Commonly used commands are on the left, specialized ones on the right.

::: callout-note
You can’t remove the ribbon, but you can minimize it using [CTRL + F1]{.uicontrol}. Press it again to restore.

6 - Workbook Name

:   Displays the name of the file.

7 - Command Button

:   Click to execute a command. It may apply changes immediately or open a menu or dialog box.

8 - Active Cell

:   The selected cell is outlined in black. In @fig-excel-window, the active cell is `A1`.

9 - Name Box

:   Located next to the formula bar. It shows the reference of the active cell or its assigned name. You can also assign names here.

10 - Formula Bar

If this is the first time saving the file, Excel will prompt you with the **Save As** dialog.

2.  Select a location.

3.  Enter a file name in the [File name]{.uicontrol} field and click [Save]{.uicontrol}.
:::

## Save As {#sec-intro-document-saveas}

To create multiple versions of a workbook or use a different format, choose [Save As]{.uicontrol}.

You can specify both the name and file format:
