### About the author {.unnumbered}

![Ben Welman](images/benw2.png){.quarto-cover-image .image-fluid width="150"}I studied Chemical Engineering at the [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/en/). After teaching chemistry and mathematics at secondary schools for a several years, I began teaching informatics and statistics at [Saxion University of Applied Sciences](https://www.saxion.edu/). From there, I transitioned internally to MeetingPoint, which focused on developing and supporting e-learning. In 1993 I founded [Softwijs](https://bwelman.github.io/softwijs/), which I closed at the end of 2018.

Since my retirement, I've enjoyed my hobbies: billiards, bridge, brewing beer, baking bread, and traveling (especially with my camper and bike). In addition to creating textbooks, I also spend time exploring data analysis, particularly with [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) and  to a lesser extent with [Python](https://www.python.org/).
