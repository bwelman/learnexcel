**OBJECTIVES**

-   Understand the layout and operation of a data table with one input variable.
-   Understand the layout and operation of a data table with two input variables.
:::

A data table is a tool for "what-if" analyses. It allows you to quickly calculate results for formulas with one or two variables, using different values for those variables. This helps you track how small changes in input values affect the results of formulas that depend on those inputs. For example, you can analyze how changes in an item's price affect the company's sales. This type of analysis is often called sensitivity analysis. The only limitation is that you can use a maximum of two variables in the formulas.

Excel offers two types of data tables:

-   One-variable data table: Uses one input variable and one or more formulas.
-   Two-variable data table: Uses two input variables and one formula.

Both types of data tables operate in a similar way:

-   Define a set of input values for the variables.
-   Identify the formulas that depend on these variables.
-   Execute the [Data Table]{.uicontrol} command.

Excel then substitutes each input value into the formulas, calculates the results, and displays them in a table format.

## One-Variable Data Table {#sec-datatables-variable-one}

If you want to calculate the result of a formula with one variable for various values of that variable, you can do so by creating two columns: one for the variable's values and the other for the formula's results.

@fig-formula-example illustrates this for the formula $y = 2*x - 1$.

![Example with formulas in each cel.](images/datatables/formula-example.png){#fig-formula-example}

However, in such cases, it's much more convenient to create a data table with one input cell.

In a column-oriented table, your variable values are arranged in a column, and the formula is placed one row above and one cell to the right of the column of values. You can enter additional formulas in the cells to the right of the first formula.

In a row-oriented data table, the variable values are in a row, and the formula(s) are in the cell one column to the left of the first value and one cell below the row of values. You can enter additional formulas in the cells below the first formula.

![General layout of a data table with one input cell.](images/datatables/datatable-layout1.png){#fig-datatable-layout1}

::: callout-note
1.  The **input cell** can be any cell on the worksheet. Excel uses this cell as a temporary storage location. The formulas must reference this input cell. The values for the variable are sent to this input cell, the result is calculated, and then it's placed in the table.

2.  Instead of formulas, you can also use references to formulas.

## Rental Cottage {#sec-datatables-rental-fixed}

Here's a simple example of a data table with one input cell.

A summer cottage can be rented for \$450 a week. The weekly expenses are \$175. Use a data table to calculate the revenue for 5, 10, 15, ..., 50 weeks.

![Rental cottage with a fixed price.](images/datatables/cottage-rental-fixed.png){#fig-cottage-rental-fixed}

The data table will be in the range A7:B17. The formula referencing the input cell B5 will be in B7. The values for the variable will be in the range A8:A17, and the results will go into B8:B17.

::: {#prp-datatables-rental-fixed}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `Rental_fixed.xlsx`

1.  Open the file.

2.  In cell B7, enter the formula `=B5*(B3-B4)`.

3.  Select the range for the data table, A7:B17.

4.  Choose [Data tab \> What-If Analysis (Forecast group) \> Data Table]{.uicontrol}.

![Input cells for Data Table.](images/datatables/datatable-dialogbox.png){#fig-datatable-dialogbox}

5.  Click inside the [Column input cell]{.uicontrol} box, and then click on cell B5.

Excel will change the cell address to \$B\$5.

6.  Click [OK]{.uicontrol}.

TThe data table will be populated with the calculated values.

The formula in the result cells is an array formula: `{=TABLE(,B5)}`. You can verify this.

## Calculating Multiple Formula Values {#sec-datatables-formulas-multiple}

Here's an example using a data table with one input cell to calculate values for multiple formulas.

The task is to calculate the *y*-values of four functions for different *x*-values.

![Calculation model for 4 formulas.](images/datatables/datatable-formulas4.png){#fig-datatable-formulas4}

The input cell will be B1. This is where the different *x*-values will be entered. The formulas used are shown in cells C2:F2, and the formulas themselves are in cells C3:F3. The *x*-values are in cells B4:B9.

::: {#prp-datatables-formulas-multiple}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `Function_values.xlsx`

1.  Open the file.

2.  Enter the correct formulas in cells C3:F3:

    -   C3: `=2*B1-1`
    -   D3: `=-3*B1+2`
    -   E3: `=B1^2`
    -   F3: `=B1^2-2*B1+1`

3.  Select the range for the data table, B3:F9.

4.  Choose [tab Data \> What-If Analysis (Forecast group) \> Data Table]{.uicontrol}.

5.  Click inside the [Column input cell]{.uicontrol} box, and then click on cell B1.

6.  Click [OK]{.uicontrol}.

![Results of the formulas in a data table.](images/datatables/datatable-formulas4-results.png){#fig-datatable-formulas4-results}

The formula in the result cells is an array formula: `{=TABLE(,B1)}`. You can verify this.

## Two-Variable Data Table {#sec-datatables-variable-two}

The two-variable data table uses a formula that contains two sets of input values. The formula must refer to two different input cells: the row input cell and the column input cell.

![General layout of a data table with 2 input cells.](images/datatables/datatable-layout2.png){#fig-datatable-layout2}

The overall layout resembles a data table with one input cell, but there are some important differences:

-   A data table with one input cell can evaluate multiple formulas, while a table with two input cells can only calculate the results from one formula.
-   The values for the variables are arranged in both a column and a row.
-   The upper-left cell must contain the formula (or a reference to the formula).

## Rental Cottage with Variable Price {#sec-datatables-rental-variable}

Here's an example of a data table with two input cells.

A summer cottage can be rented for \$350-\$600 per week, with the price varying by season. The weekly expenses are fixed at \$175. Use a data table to calculate the revenue for 5, 10, 15, ..., 50 weeks and rental prices of 350, 400, 450, ..., 600.

![Rental cottage with a variable price.](images/datatables/cottage-rental-variable.png){#fig-cottage-rental-variable}

The data table will be in the range A7:G17. The two input cells are B3 (rental price) and B5 (number of rental weeks). Cell A7 contains a formula that references the two input cells. The values for input cell B3 are in row B7:G7. The values for input cell B5 are in column A8:A17.

::: {#prp-datatables-rental-variable}

## Revenues from an Advertising Campaign {#sec-datatables-advertising}

Here's an example of a two-variable data table used to calculate the effect of an advertising campaign.

A company wants to run an advertising campaign by sending direct mail flyers to potential customers. We'll use a calculation model to calculate the expected profit of this campaign.

![Calculation model for an advertising campaign.](images/datatables/advertising-model.png){#fig-advertising-model}

The calculation model uses two variables: the number of flyers sent and the response percentage. The printing and shipping costs, as well as the expected revenue per response, are fixed values. The number of responses, total revenue, costs, and profit are calculated using formulas.

The range for the data table is B14:I23. The two input cells are B1 and B2. The values for input cell B1 are in column B15:B23. The values for input cell B2 are in row C14:I14. Cell B14 contains a reference to the total profit formula, which in turn references the two input cells.

[File]{.smallcaps}: `Advertising_Campaign.xlsx`

1.  Open the file.

2.  Select the range for the data table, B14:I23.

3.  Choose [Data tab\> What-If Analysis (Forecast group) \> Data Table]{.uicontrol}.

4.  Click inside the [Row input cell]{.uicontrol} box, and then click on cell B2.

5.  Click inside the [Column input cell]{.uicontrol} box, and then click on cell B1.

6.  Click [OK]{.uicontrol}.

![Results of the advertising campaign.](images/datatables/advertising-results.png){#fig-advertising-results}

The formula in the result cells is an array formula: `{=TABLE(B2,B1)}`. You can verify this.
