Researchers often want to know whether the value of one variable depends on another. To determine this, they conduct measurements. During these measurements, one variable is changed (**independent variable**), while another variable is measured (**dependent variable**).

These measurements produce a series of data points that can be plotted on a chart. The shape of the chart often provides an initial indication of whether a relationship exists between the variables—and if so, what kind: linear, exponential, logarithmic, etc.

A relationship between variables is represented by a mathematical function and described by an equation. If the relationship is linear, the chart will display a straight line.

When plotting measurement results, there usually isn't a single line that fits all data points perfectly. Using statistical methods, applications like Excel can determine the best-fitting line, known as a regression line. The method used to calculate this line is called the [least-squares method]{.term}. The underlying statistical techniques are beyond the scope of this chapter. If you're interested in learning more, consult additional literature.

## Linear Relationship {#sec-meas-linear}

If there is a linear relationship between two variables $x$ and $y$, it can be expressed by the equation:

$y = ax + b$

-   $y$: the dependent variable
-   $x$: the independent variable
-   $a$: the slope (a constant)
-   $b$: the intercept (a constant)

::: {#exm-meas-linear}
$y = 2x + 3$

The graph of $y=2x+3$ is a straight line. The slope of the line, $a$, is 2, and the intercept (where the line crosses the y-axis), $b$, is 3.

With measurement results, you can use Excel to

-   plot the data points.
-   draw a trendline (best-fitting line).
-   display the trendline equation.
-   calculate the slope and intercept using Excel functions.

## Linear Trendline {#sec-meas-trendline-linear}

This section explains how to add a linear trendline.

At a timber factory, large numbers of similar items are produced, primarily differing in size and weight. To investigate whether production time depends on item weight, several measurements are taken. A linear relationship is assumed.

:::: {#prp-meas-trendline-linear}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `Prodtime_Weight.xlsx`

1.  Open the file.

2.  Select the range A2:B11, which contains the measurements.

3.  Go to [Insert tab\> Recommended Charts (Charts group) \> Scatter \> OK]{.uicontrol}.

4.  Add a linear trendline.

::: {.content-visible when-format="html:js"}
`r hide("Hint")`

You can add a trendline in the following ways:

-   Click the data points in the chart, right-click, and choose [Add Trendline]{.uicontrol}.
-   Select the chart area, click the button ![](images/common/button-chart-elements.png) next to it, and choose [Trendline \> Linear]{.uicontrol}.

`r unhide()`
:::

5.  Select the trendline and [Right-click \> Format Trendline]{.uicontrol}.

6.  In the ***Format Trendline*** pane, check [Display equation on chart]{.uicontrol}.

![Trendline options.](images/measurements/trendline-options.png){#fig-trendline-options}

7.  Make the following adjustments (see the example in @fig-prodtime-chart-xy):

    -   Add a chart title and axis titles.
    -   Adjust the axes scales.
    -   Remove decimal places from axis labels.
    -   Set the trendline color to solid red.
    -   Move the equation to a visible location.

![Scatter plot of the measurements with linear trendline.](images/measurements/prodtime-chart-xy.png){#fig-prodtime-chart-xy}

From the trendline equation, you can determine the relationship between the variables:

$Productiontime = 2,955 \times Weight + 41,99$

**Worksheet functions**

You can use Excel's statistical functions `SLOPE` and `INTERCEPT` to find the slope and y-intercept of the trendline.

8.  In an empty cell, insert the `SLOPE` function with the following arguments:

    -   [Known_ys]{.uicontrol}: B2:B11
    -   [Known_xs]{.uicontrol}: A2:A11

9.  In another cell, use the `INTERCEPT` function with the same ranges.

The slope is 2.95503212 and the intercept is 41.99036403, which correspond to the trendline equation.
