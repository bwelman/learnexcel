# Data Entry and Editing {#sec-data}

**OBJECTIVES**

-   Entering data.
-   Language dependent number separators.
-   The difference between content and formatting of a cell.
-   Inserting rows and columns.
-   Copying data to other places
-   Entering data conntaining a pattern.
:::

Entering data (text, numbers, formulas) is one of the main activities in Excel. In short, it involves:

1.  Select a cell.
2.  Start typing.
3.  Press the [Enter key]{.uicontrol}.

::: callout-warning
Be aware that if the cell already contains content, this content will be overwritten.
:::

After you press the [Enter]{.uicontrol} key, the cell cursor automatically moves down one cell.

## Language-dependent number formats {#sec-data-decimal-separator}

Separators for decimals and thousands depend on the Windows language settings but can be changed in Excel. By default, Excel uses the number formats defined in Windows, with these characters:

English

:   Decimal separator **period** (`12.34`)

:   Thousands separator **comma** (`12,345`)

Dutch

:   Decimal separator **comma** (`12,34`)

:   Thousands separator **period** (`12.345`)

To change these settings permanently, you must do so through the regional settings in the Windows Control Panel.

::: callout-note
You can temporarily change these settings in Excel. To do this:

1.  Click [File \> Options \> Advanced]{.uicontrol}
2.  In the “Editing options” section , uncheck [Use system separators]{.uicontrol}.
3.  Enter the new separator in the [Decimal separator]{.uicontrol} and [Thousands separator]{.uicontrol} boxes.

To revert to the system separators, check the [Use system separators]{.uicontrol} box again.

## Data entry examples {#sec-data-entry}

A simple exercise in data entry.

::: {#prp-data-entry}
1.  Select cell A1.

2.  Type `home` and press [Enter]{.uicontrol}.

The word "home" is left-aligned in the cell and the active cell moves down to A2.

3.  Type `Sales 1e quarter` and press [Enter]{.uicontrol}.

The text is left-aligned and appears to extend beyond the cell boundaries. However, the text is fully contained in cell A2; it only *appears* to overlap cell B2 because B2 is empty. The active cell is now A3.

4.  Type `89` and press [Enter]{.uicontrol}.

The number is right-aligned in cell A3. The active cell is now A4.

5.  Type `12.34` and press [Enter]{.uicontrol}.

The number is right-aligned in cell A4. The active cell is now A5.

6.  Type `5,6` and press [Enter]{.uicontrol}.

The content of cell A5 is left-aligned. The comma causes Excel to interpret the entry as text, which is why it's left-aligned. The active cell is A6.

7.  Type `1/2/2011` and press [Enter]{.uicontrol}.

The date is right-aligned. Excel interprets dates as numbers and applies a special date format. The active cell is now A7.

8.  Type `=2+3` and press [Enter]{.uicontrol}.

The cell displays the number 5. Excel interprets entries starting with `=` as formulas, calculates the result, and displays it. The cell's *content* is the formula, not the result. The active cell is now A8.

9.  Select cell B2, type `10%` and press [Enter]{.uicontrol}.

The content in cell B2 is right-aligned. The percent sign tells Excel to interpret the data as a number. The actual content of this cell is `0.1`, which is formatted and displayed as a percentage. Because cell B2 is no longer empty, the full text in cell A2 is now truncated in the display.

10. Select cell [A2]{.uicontrol}.

The formula bar shows the complete text entered in the cell.

![The active cell is A2 and the formula bar shows the entire content of this cell.](images/data/data-entry-example.png){#fig-data-entry-example}

You can adjust the column width to display all the text in cell A2.
:::

**Summary**

-   Text is left-aligned by default.
-   Numbers are right-aligned by default.
-   Commas and periods have different meanings in numbers.
-   Formulas always begin with the `=` character.
-   Dates are treated as numbers and formatted as dates.
-   Numbers with a percent sign are treated as numbers and formatted as percentages. The cell content is the numerical equivalent (e.g., 10% is stored as 0.1).
-   A cell has content and a format. What you see isn't always the actual content.

## Editing cell content {#sec-data-edit}

You can edit cell data in one of these ways:

-   Double-click the cell. The cursor appears in the cell, allowing you to edit the content directly.
-   Select the cell and press F2. The cursor moves to the end of the cell content for editing.
-   Select the cell and click in the formula bar to position the cursor for editing.

When a cell is in edit mode, the status bar (bottom left) changes from "Ready" to "Edit." Three icons also appear to the left of the formula bar:

![](images/common/formulabar-icons.png)

These icons allow you to undo, confirm, or insert a function.

You must presse [Enter]{.uicontrol} to finalize changes and return to "Ready" mode.

## Undoing changes {#sec-data-undo-changes}

You can undo most actions in Excel using the [Undo]{.uicontrol} and [Redo]{.uicontrol} buttons on the [Quick Access Toolbar]{.uicontrol}.

![Undo](images/common/button-undo.png) Undo

:   Reverses the last action. Clicking it repeatedly undoes previous actions. The dropdown arrow next to the button displays a list of recent actions. Clicking an action in the list undoes all actions up to and including that one.

![Redo](images/common/button-redo.png) Redo

:   Reverses the effect of the Undo action. The dropdown arrow (if available) shows a list of undone actions that can be redone.

## Inserting rows and columns {#sec-data-insert-rowcolumn}

You'll often need to insert rows or columns within existing data. The process is the same for both.

1.  Right-click the row or column header.
2.  Choose [Insert]{.uicontrol}.

To insert multiple rows or columns, select the desired number of rows/columns, right-click, and select [Insert]{.uicontrol}. The new rows or columns are inserted *before* the first row or column of your selection.

## Copy and Paste {#sec-data-copypaste}

Copying cell content is a common task in Excel. You can copy a single cell or an entire range. By default, Excel copies both the content and formatting of the cells. However, you can choose to copy only the content or only the formatting. When you copy a formula with cell references, the references adjust to the new location.

::: {#prp-data-copypaste}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `Cellformat.xlsx`

1.  Open the file.
2.  Select the range A1:B13.
3.  Choose [Home \> Copy (Clipboard group)]{.uicontrol}.
4.  Select the upper-left cell of the destination, for example, D20.
5.  Choose [Home \> Past (Clipboard group]{.uicontrol}.

## Auto fill {#sec-data-autofill}

How to quickly enter data that follows a pattern.

Excel provides several ways to quickly fill rows or columns with data that follows a pattern or is based on a list. Excel has built-in lists for days of the week and months of the year, and you can create custom lists in Excel's options. You can also enter a pattern that Excel recognizes and continues. Often, two values are enough for Excel to identify the pattern.

You can use the fill handle to quickly enter data series. The fill handle is the small black square in the lower-right corner of a selected cell or range. When you hover the mouse pointer over the fill handle, the pointer changes from ![](images/common/mouse-shape-select.png) to ![](images/common/mouse-shape-fill.png), and you can then drag to fill.

![Fill handle.](images/common/mouse-fill-handle.png){#fig-mouse-fillhandle}

The following exercise demonstrates using a built-in list and pattern recognition. The table that follows provides examples for further experimentation.

::: {#prp-data-autofill}
**Built-in list**

1.  Create a new worksheet.

2.  Select cell A1 and type "January".

3.  Select cell A1 again. Position the mouse over the fill handle of cell A1. Press and hold the left mouse button, drag down to cell A12, and then release the mouse button.

![](images/data/months-names-long.png).

The range A1:A12 is filled with the months of the year. You can start with any month, and the sequence will repeat if you continue dragging.

**Pattern recognition**

4.  Select cell B1 and type the number 1.

5.  Select cell B2 and type the number 2.

6.  Select the range B1:B2 and drag the fill handle down several cells. ![](images/data/numbers-autofill.png).

The range is filled with the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on.

@tbl-patternrecognition shows examples for you to experiment with.
