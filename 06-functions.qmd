**OBJECTIVES**

-   Types of functions and the syntax of a function.
-   Entering a function manually and with the Wizard.
-   Nesting of functions.
:::

Excel has more than 300 built-in functions to perform various operations. These functions are organized into categories, such as:

-   Database
-   Date & Time
-   Financial
-   Information
-   Logical
-   Statistical
-   Engineering
-   Text
-   Math & Trig
-   Lookup & Reference

Categories can be helpful when searching for a specific function. For example, to find a function that calculates loan repayments, you can look in the Financial category. Other categories include: All, Most Recently Used, and User Defined.

Most functions require you to specify the values or cell contents they should use in the calculation. These are called **arguments**.

All Excel functions follow the same structure (syntax), as shown in @fig-function-syntax.

![The structure (syntax) of a function.](images/functions/function-syntax.png){#fig-function-syntax}

-   They begin with an equal sign `=`.

<!-- -->

-   Followed by the function's name.

<!-- -->

-   Then, parentheses enclose the arguments, separated by commas.

<!-- -->

-   Arguments can be numbers, text, operators, or even other functions.

::: callout-note
1.  The argument separator (comma or semicolon) depends on your Windows regional settings. English versions typically use a comma, while other language versions (e.g., Dutch) may use a semicolon. You can change this in the Windows Control Panel.

2.  Function names and argument separators vary depending on the language version of Microsoft Office.
:::

This chapter discusses some commonly used functions through practical examples.

## Entering Functions {#sec-function-enter}

You can enter functions using the Function Wizard or manually. The best method depends on your experience level and whether you already know the function's name and syntax. Both methods are explained below. The Function Wizard is used in the examples, but you can also enter functions manually.

### Function Wizard {#function-wizard}

The [Function Wizard]{.uicontrol} is helpful for beginners and less experienced users. You can open it in two ways:

-   Click the $f_x$ [Insert function]{.uicontrol} button at the beginning of the formula bar.
-   Go to [Formulas \> Insert Function (Function Library group)]{.uicontrol}

The Insert Function dialog box will appear:

![Dialog box insert function.](images/functions/function-insert.png){#fig-function-insert}

To quickly find the right function, first select a function category from the drop-down list. If you're unsure which category to choose, select [All]{.uicontrol}.

Select the desired function, such as `COUNTIF`, and click [OK]{.uicontrol}. The ***Function Arguments*** dialog box for the selected function will appear.

![Function arguments for function COUNTIF.](images/functions/function-countif.png){#fig-function-countif1}

In this dialog box, you can specify the function's arguments. The required arguments depend on the selected function. You can type the arguments directly, or for cell addresses, you can select the cells in the worksheet using the mouse.

::: callout-note
For detailed help on the function, click the [Help on this function]{.uicontrol} link.
:::

### Autocomplete Functions {#sec-function-manual}

If you are familiar with a particular function, its correct spelling, and the types of arguments it requires, you can type the function and its arguments directly into the formula bar. This is often the most efficient method.

Excel's **Autocomplete Functions** feature is very useful for manual entry. When you type an `=` sign and the first few letters of a function in a cell or the formula bar, Excel displays a drop-down list of all valid entries that begin with those letters. Icons indicate the entry type, such as a function or cell/table reference. A screen tip also provides a brief description of each function.

Continue typing the function name to narrow the list, or use the arrow keys to select the function from the list. After selecting the desired function, press [Tab]{.uicontrol} to insert the function name and an opening parenthesis into the cell.

Once you insert the function and the opening parenthesis, Excel displays another screen tip showing the function's arguments. The argument in bold is the one you are currently entering. Arguments in parentheses are optional.

::: {#exm-autocomplete}
**Autocomplete**

@fig-function-autocomplete illustrates an example. In the first image, the letter c has been entered. The list box displays all functions that start with `c`.

In the second image, `ou` has been added. The list now shows all entries that start with `cou`. A screen tip displays information for the selected function, `COUNTIF`.

Pressing [Tab]{.uicontrol} results in the third image. This function requires two arguments.

![Example autocomplete function.](images/functions/function-autocomplete.png){#fig-function-autocomplete}
:::

## Autosum {#sec-function-autosum}

Since addition is a frequently used operation, Excel provides the [Autosum]{.uicontrol} button on the ribbon in the [Editing group (Home tab)]{.uicontrol} for quick entry. Using the Function Wizard for addition often requires multiple mouse clicks, so Autosum can save time.

![](images/functions/button-autosum.png)

The arrow next to the Autosum button provides a drop-down list with quick access to the [Average]{.uicontrol}, [Count Numbers]{.uicontrol}, [Max]{.uicontrol}, and [Min]{.uicontrol} functions.

::: {#prp-function-autosum}
1.  Start with a new worksheet.

2.  Enter the following numbers in cells A1:A6: 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, and 125.

3.  Select cell A7, and then click the [Autosum]{.uicontrol} button.

![Selection borders around cells to sum.](images/functions/example-autosum.png){#fig-example-autosum}

Excel places a selection border around the cells that it assumes you want to sum. If this is not the correct range, use the mouse to select the desired area.

4.  Confirm the selection by doing one of the following:

    -   Click the [Autosum]{.uicontrol} button again.
    -   Click the [Enter]{.uicontrol} button, ![](images/functions/enter-function.svg), in the formula bar.
    -   Press the [Enter]{.uicontrol} key on the keyboard.

Cell A7 will display the result `735`. The formula in cell A7 is `=SUM(A1:A6)`, which is shorter and clearer than `=A1+A2+A3+A4+A5+A6`.
:::

## Mathematical Functions {#sec-function-math}

The mathematical functions category is quite extensive. In addition to the common SUM function for adding numbers, this category includes functions for various calculations, such as exponentiation, square roots, PI, logarithms, and trigonometry.

Functions for rounding numbers are common. Excel provides thirteen rounding functions, which can make it challenging to choose the appropriate function. For example, the `ROUND` function rounds a number up or down to a specified number of decimal places. Other functions round to the nearest multiple of a given number or to the nearest integer.

::: {#prp-function-math}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `Rounding.xlsx`

@fig-example-rounding shows the results of several rounding functions. Column C displays the formulas used in column B.

![Examples of rounding functions.](images/functions/example-rounding.png){#fig-example-rounding}

1.  Open the file.

2.  Enter the appropriate formulas in cells B3:B9 using the Function Wizard.
:::

## Statistical Functions {#sec-function-statistical}

The statistical category contains functions for statistical analysis, such as average, count, minimum, and maximum.

::::: {#prp-function-statistical}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `Statistics.xlsx`

![File Statistics.xlsx to practice statistical functions.](images/functions/example-statistical.png){#fig-example-statistical}

1.  Open the file.

2.  In cells B9 to B12, perform the calculations using the functions from the table below. These functions are in the [Statistical]{.uicontrol} category.

    -   B9: `AVERAGE`
    -   B10: `COUNT`
    -   B11: `MIN`
    -   B12: `MAX`

::: callout-note
The argument is always the range B1:B8. Although you can type this range in the Function Arguments dialog box, it's more convenient to place the cursor in the box for the first argument and then select the range B1:B8 in the worksheet with the mouse.

## Date and Time Functions {#sec-function-datetime}

The Date and Time category provides functions for working with dates and times. Because Excel stores dates and times as numbers internally, you can perform calculations with them. The American date format is Month/Day/Year.

:::: {#prp-function-datetime}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `Date.xlsx`

![Calculation with dates and times..](images/functions/example-datetime.png){#fig-example-datetime}

1.  Open the file.

First, extract the year, month, and day values from the start and end dates.

2.  Use the `YEAR`, `MONTH` and `DAY` functions to determine the values in cells C2, D2, and E2. The argument for these functions is cell B2.

3.  Select C2:E2 and drag the fill handle one row down.

4.  Select cell B4 and enter the formula `=B3-B2`. The result is 27.

The `NETWORKDAYS` function calculates the number of workdays between a start date and an end date. It excludes weekends and dates specified as holidays. You can use an optional argument to specify holidays.

5.  Select cell B5, and calculate the number of workdays. Enter the cell addresses for the start and end dates; leave the holidays box empty.

6.  Similarly, calculate the hours, minutes, and seconds from the start and end dates using the `HOUR`, `MINUTE`, and `SECOND` functions.

7.  Calculate the time difference in B10 using a formula.

::: {.content-visible when-format="html:js"}
`r hide("Hint")`

Subtract the start time from the end time.

## Logical Function IF {#sec-function-logical}

Logical functions work with the results `TRUE` or `FALSE`. The most common logical function is the `IF()` function. In simple terms, this function works as follows:

`=IF(condition, value_ if_true, value_if_false)`

The condition is a logical test that evaluates to either `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

::: callout-note
For more than one condition, you can nest `IF()` functions. However, nested `IF()` functions can become complex and difficult to read. Consider using the logical functions `AND()`, `OR()`, and `NOT()` instead.
:::

::: {#prp-function-logical}
@fig-example-logical-result shows marks with their corresponding pass/fail status. The status is determined automatically based on the mark. A mark less than 5.5 is considered failing.

![Marks with their results.](images/functions/example-logical-result.png){#fig-example-logical-result}

1.  Start a new worksheet and enter the numbers shown in @fig-example-logical-result.

2.  Select cell B2 and use the [Insert Function]{.uicontrol} to insert the `IF` function.

3.  Complete the dialog box as shown in @fig-example-logical-if. You can type the quotation marks around the text, but it is not required as Excel will add them automatically.

![Dialog box function IF.](images/functions/example-logical-if.png){#fig-example-logical-if}

4.  Click [OK]{.uicontrol}.

5.  Select cell B2 and drag the fill handle to B6.
:::

## Text Functions {#sec-function-text}

This section demonstrates splitting text into different parts using four text functions.

Excel includes functions for manipulating text. For example, you can determine the length of a text string or extract specific parts of a string.

@fig-example-text-result shows full names in column A. The goal is to extract the first and last names into separate columns. In this example, the first and last names are separated by a space, which can be used as a delimiter. To extract the names, you need to find the position of the space and know the total length of the text. The text before the space is the first name, and the text after the space is the last name.

The results are shown in columns B to E in @fig-example-text-result. This exercise is divided into four parts, each using a different function.

![Full names and the extracted fiirst and last names.](images/functions/example-text-result.png){#fig-example-text-result}

### LEN {#sec-function-length}

The `LEN` function determines the length of a text string.

::: {#prp-function-text}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `Names.xlsx`

1.  Open the file.

2.  Select cell B2 and insert the `LEN` function with cell A2 as argument.

3.  Drag the fill handle in B2 down to B5.

Column B now displays the length of the full names.
:::

### SEARCH {#sec-function-search}

The `SEARCH` function finds the starting position of a specific character (or string) within a text. In this case, it finds the position of the space.

::: {#prp-function-search}
1.  Select cell [C2]{.uicontrol} and click the [Insert Function]{.uicontrol} button on the formula bar.

![Arguments for function SEARCH. Enter a space in the Find-text box. Excel surrounds this automatically with double quotes.](images/functions/example-text-search.png){#fig-example-text-search}

2.  Click [OK]{.uicontrol}.

3.  Drag the fill handle in C2 down to C5.

Column C now displays the position of the first space in each name.
:::

### LEFT {#sec-function-left}

The `LEFT` function extracts a specified number of characters from the beginning of a text string. In this example, it extracts the first name.

:::: {#prp-function-left}
1.  Select cell D2, insert the `LEFT` function, and enter the arguments as shown in @fig-example-text-left.

::: callout-note
In the Num-chars box, specify the length of the text to extract. This is one less than the position of the space, which is found in cell C2.
:::

![Arguments for function LEFT.](images/functions/example-text-left.png){#fig-example-text-left}

2.  Click [OK]{.uicontrol}.

3.  Drag the fill handle in D2 down to D5.

Column D now displays the first names.
::::

### RIGHT {#sec-function-right}

The `RIGHT` function extracts a specified number of characters from the end of a text string. In this example, it extracts the last name.

::: {#prp-function-right}
1.  Select cell E2, insert the `RIGHT` function, and enter the arguments as shown in @fig-example-text-right.

![Arguments for function RIGHT.](images/functions/example-text-right.png){#fig-example-text-right}

2.  Click [OK]{.uicontrol}.

3.  Drag the fill handle in E2 down to E5.

Column E now displays the last names.
:::

## Nested Functions {#sec-function-nesting}

A nested function is a function within another function, where one function acts as an argument for the other. For example:

`=ROUNDDOWN(SUM(A1:A5),0)`

The following exercise uses a nested function.

:::: {#prp-function-nesting}
1.  Start a new worksheet, and enter the data shown in @fig-example-nesting.

![Data to use with nested function.](images/functions/example-nesting.png){#fig-example-nesting}

2.  Select cell A6, and insert the `ROUNDDOWN` function (from the [Math & Trig]{.uicontrol} category).

In the function's arguments dialog box, the cursor will be in the [Number]{.uicontrol} field. It's often helpful to specify the number of decimal places first, and then define the range of numbers.

3.  Place the cursor in the [Num_digits]{.uicontrol} field, enter `0`, Then, move the cursor back to the [Number]{.uicontrol} field.

![Dialoogvenster.](images/functions/example-nesting-decimals.png){#fig-example-nesting-decimals}

4.  Click the arrow in the name box on the worksheet.

A drop-down list appears, showing the names of the most recently used functions. At the bottom of this list, you'll see [More Functions]{.uicontrol}.

5.  Click on [More Functions]{.uicontrol}. The familiar Insert Function dialog box will appear.

6.  In the [Math & Trig]{.uicontrol} category, select the `SUM` function and click [OK]{.uicontrol}.

The Function Arguments dialog box appears. The [Number1]{.varname} argument already contains the value A1:A5.

7.  Click [OK]{.uicontrol}.

The result appears in cell A6, and the formula used is displayed in the formula bar.

![Result nested function.](images/functions/example-nesting-result.png){#fig-example-nesting-result}

::: callout-note
1.  If you hadn't entered the number of decimals after step 3, you would have received a warning during nesting indicating that too few arguments were entered. You would have had to correct this manually in the formula.

2.  A faster way to work is to type the formula directly into the formula bar. As you type, you'll receive assistance with entering the formula. However, this method requires you to know the names of the functions you want to use.
:::
::::

## COUNTIF {#sec-function-countif}

The `COUNTIF` function is very useful for creating frequency tables. @fig-example-countif shows a list of camping sites and their categories. Column E will contain the number of campsites in each category.

![Campsites by category.](images/functions/example-countif.png){#fig-example-countif}

::::: {#prp-function-countif}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `Campsites.xlsx`

1.  Open the file.

2.  Select cell E2, insert the `COUNTIF` function, and specify the arguments as shown in @fig-function-countif2.

![Arguments for the function COUNTIF.](images/functions/function-countif.png){#fig-function-countif2}

::: callout-note
Specifying the entire column B as the range allows you to add new rows of data to the bottom without needing to change the formulas.
:::

3.  Click [OK]{.uicontrol}.

4.  Select cell E2 and drag the fill handle down to E5.

::: {.content-visible when-format="html:js"}
`r hide("Result")`

![](images/functions/example-countif-result.png)

`r unhide()`
:::
:::::

## SUMIF {#sec-function-sumif}

The `SUMIF` function allows you to add numbers based on specific conditions. The spreadsheet contains a list of yields for different coffee types, organized by month and region. You'll use it to determine the total yields per region.

::::: {#prp-function-sumif}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `Coffee.xlsx`

1.  Open the file.

2.  Select cell H2, insert the `SUMIF` function, and enter the arguments as shown in @fig-example-sumif-arguments.

![Arguments for function SUMIF.](images/functions/example-sumif-arguments.png){#fig-example-sumif-arguments}

3.  Click [OK]{.uicontrol}. The total yield for North region, 743140, now appears in cell H2.

4.  Select cell H2 and drag down the fill handle to H5.

5.  Format the numbers in H2:H5 as currency.

::: {.content-visible when-format="html:js"}
`r hide("Resultaat")`

![](images/functions/example-sumif-result.png)

`r unhide()`
:::

::: callout-note
In this case, a pivot table would be an easier way to create this summary.

:::::

## Calculating Annuities {#sec-function-annuity}

There are several ways to calculate loan repayments. This example calculates the monthly repayment amount for a \$250,000 loan with a 6% fixed annual interest rate over 15 years, using an annuity. We'll use the Excel function `PMT`, which calculates the payment for a loan based on constant periodic payments and a constant interest rate.

![Data to use for loan repayment.](images/functions/example-annuity.png){#fig-example-annuity}

::::: {#prp-function-annuity}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `Repayment.xlsx`

1.  Open the file and format the cells as shown in @fig-example-annuity.

2.  Select cell B4, insert the `PMT` function (from the [Financial]{.uicontrol} category) and enter the arguments as shown in @fig-example-annuity-arguments.

![Arguments for function PMT.](images/functions/example-annuity-arguments.png){#fig-example-annuity-arguments}

::: callout-note
Because the period in this example is in months rather than years, the annual interest rate must be divided by 12, and the number of years must be multiplied by 12.
:::

3.  Click [OK]{.uicontrol}.

::: callout-note
The result -2109.64 appears. Because this is an amount to be paid (a debt), Excel displays it as a negative number, shown in red font and with a minus sign.
:::

4.  To change this to a positive number, insert a minus sign after the `=` sign in the formula. The formula will then be `=-PMT(B2/12,B3*12,B1)`.
:::::

## Calculating Number of Periods {#sec-function-nper}

Suppose you take out a personal loan of €4,000 and agree to pay a monthly amount of €125. Calculate the number of months it will take to repay the loan at a 6% fixed annual interest rate. For this calculation, we'll use the Excel function `NPER`. This function calculates the number of periods for an investment based on periodic, constant payments and a constant interest rate.

::: callout-important
Payments are entered as negative numbers.
:::

![Calculation of the number of periods.](images/functions/example-nper.png){#fig-example-nper}

:::: {#prp-function-nper}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `Payment_Periods.xlsx`

1.  Open the file.

2.  Select cell B4, insert the `NPER` function (from the [Financial]{.uicontrol} category) and enter the arguments as shown in @fig-example-nper-arguments.

![Arguments for `NPER` function.](images/functions/example-nper-arguments.png){#fig-example-nper-arguments}

::: callout-note
Because the period is in months and not years, the annual interest rate has been divided by 12.
:::

3.  Click [OK]{.uicontrol}. The result 34,95778166 appears, indicating almost 35 months.
::::

## Vertical Lookup {#sec-function-vlookup}

The `VLOOKUP` function searches for a specified value in the first column of a list (table) and returns the corresponding value from another column.

Syntax: `VLOOKUP(lookup-value, table-array, col-index-num, [range-lookup])`

The last argument is optional and can be set to FALSE or TRUE.

-   FALSE: Searches for an exact match with the specified lookup value.
-   TRUE: Returns the closest match *below* the lookup value if an exact match is not found.

::: callout-note
In most cases, it's best to search for an exact match; otherwise, you might get incorrect results. If you allow an approximation, the leftmost column of the table array *must* be in ascending order.
:::

@fig-example-vlookup shows an overview of hard drives, with the article number in the first column. Using the `VLOOKUP` function, you can find the capacity, type, and price of an item by entering its article number.

![Overview of hard drives.](images/functions/example-vlookup.png){#fig-example-vlookup}

Cell D2 is the input cell for the article number you want to search for. Cells D4:D7 will contain the lookup formulas.

::: {#prp-function-vlookup}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `Harddisks.xlsx`

1.  Open the file.

2.  Select cell D4 and enter the formula: `=VLOOKUP($D$2,$B$11:$E$22,1,FALSE)`.

The error `#N/A` appears in the cell because there is no search value in cell D2 yet.

3.  Enter the value `208` in cell D2. Now, 208 (the article number) appears in cell D4.

4.  Enter the correct lookup formulas in the other three cells:

    -   D5: `=VLOOKUP($D$2,$B$11:$E$22,2,FALSE)`.

    -   D6: `=VLOOKUP($D$2,$B$11:$E$22,3,FALSE)`.

    -   D7: `=VLOOKUP($D$2,$B$11:$E$22,4,FALSE)`.

![Results of VLOOKUP.](images/functions/example-vlookup-result.png){#fig-example-vlookup-result}

## Horizontal Lookup {#sec-function-hlookup}

The `HLOOKUP` function searches for a specified value in the first *row* of a list (table) and returns the corresponding value from another row.

Syntax: `VLOOKUP(lookup-value, table-array, row-index-num, [range-lookup])`

The last argument is optional and can be set to FALSE or TRUE:

-   FALSE: Searches for an exact match with the specified lookup value.
-   TRUE: Returns the closest match *to the left* of the lookup value if an exact match is not found.

::: callout-note
It's generally best to search for an exact match; otherwise, you might get incorrect results. If you allow an approximation, the top row of the table array *must* be in ascending order.
:::

@fig-example-hlookup shows an overview of shoe sizes for several people, with their names in the first row. You can use the `HLOOKUP` function to find the corresponding age, height, and shoe size when you enter a name.

![Overview of shoe sizes.](images/functions/example-hlookup.png){#fig-example-hlookup}

Cell C2 is the input cell for the name to be searched. Cells C4:C6 will contain the lookup formulas.

::: {#prp-function-hlookup}
[File]{.uicontrol}: `Shoe_Sizes.xlsx`

1.  Open the file.

2.  Select cell C4 and enter the formula `=HLOOKUP($C$2,$C$8:$E$11,2,FALSE)`.

The error `#N/A` appears in the cell because there is no search value in cell C2 yet.

3.  Enter the value `Pietersen` in cell C2. Now, 42 (the age) appears in cell C4.

4.  Enter the correct lookup formulas in the other two cells:

    -   C5: `=HLOOKUP($C$2,$C$8:$E$11;3,FALSE)`.

    -   C6: `=HLOOKUP($C$2,$C$8:$E$11;4,FALSE)`.

1.  Used functions: `DATE`, `YEAR`, `MONTH`, `DAY`, `TODAY`.

2.  You can format a date like "Wed 01/3/1967" using the cell's number format. Go to [Home tab \> Category Custom (Number group)]{.uicontrol}, or right-click the cell and select [Format Cells]{.uicontrol}. In the [Type]{.uicontrol} box, enter the desired format. The format used in the example is "ddd dd/m/yyyy". Try other formats like "dddd dd/mmm/yy" to understand how the formatting works.

3.  In Excel, a date is actually just a number, which you can use in calculations. To find the time difference between two dates, subtract them.

**Determining Commission (form004)**

[File]{.smallcaps}: `Form004.xlsx`

A company with three salespeople has a target of \$150,000 in sales per year for each person. If a salesperson reaches that amount, their commission is 6.25% of their sales. If not, their commission is only 5.5%. The following figure shows a model for calculating the commission for each salesperson.

**Birth Dates (form005)**

[File]{.smallcaps}: `Form005.xlsx`

A mother-child center at a hospital wants a daily overview of babies born too early, on time, and too late. For babies born too early or too late, they also want to know how many days early or late. For babies who are yet to be born, they want to know how many days overdue they are.

1.  The last four columns depend on one or more conditions, so you'll need to use the `IF` function.

2.  For two conditions, you can nest a second `IF` function within the first `IF` function. Alternatively, you can use the `AND` function within the `IF` function.

3.  A birth date is considered "too early" if it's before the expected date.

4.  In Excel, a date is simply a number, so you can compare dates using operators like \<, \>,

**VAT Return (form006)**

[File]{.smallcaps}: `Form006.xlsx`

A company buys goods from suppliers and pays sales tax (VAT) to those suppliers. The company then sells the goods to customers, who pay VAT to the company. Every quarter, the company must submit a tax declaration. The difference between the VAT received (from sales) and the VAT paid (to suppliers) must be paid to the tax authority. If this difference is negative, the company receives a refund. Small businesses may be eligible for a reduction in VAT through the Small Businesses Regulation (SBR). This regulation is outlined in the following table.

![](images/functions/form006-rules.png)

1.  Create a model with cells for entering the total sales and prepaid VAT, and cells for the constants (the thresholds and VAT percentage). Calculate the initial VAT to be paid, the reduction, and the final amount to be paid or received in other cells. Use a single VAT rate of 21%. The final amount should automatically be labeled as a payment or a receipt. All amounts must be formatted as whole euros.

2.  Thoroughly test the model with all possible scenarios.

**Property Tax (form008)**

[File]{.smallcaps}: `Form008.xlsx`

The property tax has two parts: an owner's portion and a user's portion. If the owner occupies the property themselves, they must pay both portions. The rate for both portions depends on the assessed value according to the WOZ Act. The property tax for 2010 in a certain community is 0.1064% of the WOZ value for the owner and 0.1224% for the user.

![](images/functions/form008-model.png)

Create this model in a worksheet. The calculated values for the owner and user depend on the answers "yes" or "no" to both questions.

The amount of heat generated by an electric current flowing through a conductor can be calculated using Joule's law: $Q = 0.24 * i^2 * R * t$

Where:

-   `Q`: The amount of heat (cal)
-   `i`: Current (ampere)
-   `R`: Resistance (ohm)
-   `t`: Time (sec)

Create a model in a worksheet where the current, resistance, and time can be entered, and the amount of heat is calculated from the entered data.

**Price of Olive Oil (form013)**

Olive oil can be purchased in 5-liter cans. The price depends on the number of cans:

-   \$45 per can for the first 20 cans
-   \$40 for any can beyond 20

Create a spreadsheet model where you can enter the total number of cans, and the total price is calculated. Use separate cells for the price per can and the 20-can limit. Name all the cells appropriately.
