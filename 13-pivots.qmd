**OBJECTIVES**

-   Understand the features of a PivotTable.
-   Learn how to create PivotTables.
-   Identify source data from a PivotTable.
-   Group date/time data.
-   Filter a PivotTable using report filters, slicers, and timelines.
-   Create PivotCharts.
:::

A PivotTable is a powerful data summarization tool. It's an interactive, dynamic table that allows you to quickly and easily summarize, combine, and compare large amounts of data. For a PivotTable to function correctly, the data must be well-organized in a worksheet.

PivotTables are particularly useful when you need to analyze variables in relation to other variables, helping you answer questions such as:

-   Which product contributes the most to profit?
-   Which salesperson generates the highest revenue?
-   Which department incurs the most costs?
-   ...

::: {#exm-supermarket}
**Sales by Category**

The PivotTable in @fig-supermarket-productcategory-town allows for an easy comparison of revenue across three product categories.

![Example of a PivotTable showing product categories plotted against locations.](images/pivots/supermarket-productcategory-town.png){#fig-supermarket-productcategory-town}

A PivotTable plots at least two types of data against each other. One data type is placed in the column field (here, [productcategory]{.varname}), and the other in the row field (here, [town]{.varname}). Additionally, a data type for which you want to see results must be placed in the value field (here, [Sales]{.varname}).

Since these results are summarized, you also need to specify the calculation method; in this case, `Sum` is the default choice.
:::

A PivotTable has four areas where you can place fields:

| Area | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Values | Fields with numeric information you want to summarize, typically for calculating totals and averages. |
| Rows | Fields used to create distinct groups, with information for each group displayed in a separate row. |
| Columns | Fields also used to create distinct groups, often for subdividing data within rows. These groups are displayed in separate columns. Choose fields with a manageable number of groups to prevent the table from becoming too wide. |
| Filters | Fields used to filter the data. |

## Creating PivotTables {#sec-pivots-creating}

The file for this task contains the monthly sales in 2016 for three supermarkets across different products, as shown in @fig-supermarket-sales-data. These products are categorized into three groups: PVF (potatoes, vegetables, fruit), meat, and dairy. This data will be analyzed using a PivotTable.

![Table displaying sales data.](images/pivots/supermarket-sales-data.png){#fig-supermarket-sales-data}

**Information needed**: What are the total sales per town per product category?.

## Finding Data Sources {#sec-pivots-datasources}

A PivotTable contains summarized data. In this task, you will learn how to find the source of this data.

A worksheet contains employee data such as sales, expenses, and commission per month and per region. A PivotTable showing sales per region per employee has been created in another worksheet.

![Sales per region per employee.](images/pivots/sales-pivot.png){#fig-sales-pivot}

If you want to see the individual values that make up a result, Excel can show you this quickly and easily. By double-clicking on a result, Excel creates a new worksheet containing a table with the source data.

::: {#prp-pivots-datasources}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `Sales.xlsx`

1.  Open the file.

2.  Select the PivotTable worksheet and double-click on the results for [Jansen]{.uicontrol} in the [East]{.uicontrol} region.

A new worksheet with a list of all information about Jansen in the East region will be created.

![Data for Jansen in the East region.](images/pivots/sales-pivot-datasource.png){#fig-sales-pivot-datasource}
:::

## Grouping Data {#sec-pivots-grouping-data}

You can make a cluttered list of data more suitable for analysis by grouping it. This is especially true when the data contains dates. Dates can often be grouped into years, quarters, or months. In a PivotTable, you can view data by year, quarter, or month.

::: {#exm-grouping-data}
**Revenue per Salesperson**

@fig-invoices-ungrouped-grouped shows part of a PivotTable displaying revenue per salesperson. In the left image, the revenue is in date order (ungrouped). In the right image, the revenue is grouped by quarter and by month.

![Revenue per salesperson: Ungrouped (left) and grouped by quarter/month (right).](images/pivots/invoices-ungrouped-grouped.png){#fig-invoices-ungrouped-grouped}
:::

Starting with version 2016, Excel includes a **time grouping** feature that automatically discovers and groups time-related fields. AutomaticallyWhen you add such a field to a PivotTable, new relevant fields like [Years]{.varname}, [Quarters]{.varname} and [Months]{.varname} are automatically created..

Which date/time fields are added depends on the level of detail of the date/time field in the data table. For example, if the date data is in days and spans more than a year, additional fields are created for months, quarters, and years.

Once these fields have been added, you can begin analyzing the data across different time periods using zoom-in options, which can sometimes reveal additional insights.

::: {#exm-grouping-data2}
**Quarterly Comparison by Year**

For example, to get a quarterly comparison over several years, you can place the [Years]{.varname} field in the [Columns]{.uicontrol} box and the [Quarters]{.varname} field in the [Rows]{.uicontrol} box.

The [+]{.uicontrol} button in the PivotTable indicates a collapsed level. Clicking this button expands all elements in the PivotTable to the next level (here, [Months]{.varname}). The [+]{.uicontrol} button then changes to a [-]{.uicontrol} button, allowing you to collapse the group again. This is also known as zooming in or [drill-down]{.term}.

![Sales per quarter per year.](images/pivots/invoices-quarters-years.png){#fig-invoices-quarters-years}
:::

Custom grouping

:   You can adjust the grouping by right-clicking on a date/time field in the PivotTable and then choosing [Group]{.uicontrol}. In the Grouping dialog box that appears, you can add or remove other time levels.

Ungroup

:   You can cancel a group by right-clicking on a grouped field in the PivotTable and then choosing [Ungroup]{.uicontrol}.

## Grouping Example {#sec-pivots-grouping-example}

This is an example of grouping data based on a date field.

:::: {#prp-pivots-grouping-example}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `Invoices.xlsx`

1.  Open the file.

The file contains a data table named [SalesData]{.varname} with columns [Region]{.varname}, [Salesman]{.varname}, [InvoiceNr]{.varname}, [InvoiceDate]{.varname}, [ProductCategory]{.varname}, and [InvoiceAmount]{.varname}.

First, a PivotTable with sales per salesman per product category will be created.

2.  Select any cell in the table. Choose [tab Insert \> PivotTable (Tables group)]{.uicontrol}.

![Specifying the data range and location for the PivotTable.](images/pivots/invoices-pivot-create.png){#fig-invoices-pivot-create}

::: callout-note
-   Since the data area here is a table named [SalesData]{.varname}, this name is automatically filled in instead of cell addresses.

-   To have the PivotTable appear on a new worksheet, accept the default option [New Worksheet]{.uicontrol}.
:::

3.  Click [OK]{.uicontrol}.

4.  Create a PivotTable according to the design in @fig-invoices-pivot-design and format the amounts as currency. The result can be seen in @fig-invoices-sales-salesman.

![PivotTable design layout.](images/pivots/invoices-pivot-design.png){#fig-invoices-pivot-design}

![Sales per salesperson per product category. Note the significant differences by seller.](images/pivots/invoices-sales-salesman.png){#fig-invoices-sales-salesman}

5.  Drag the [InvoiceDate]{.varname} field to the [Rows]{.uicontrol} area, placing it below the [Salesman]{.varname} field. Excel's automatic time grouping feature will create two calculated fields, [Years]{.varname} and [Quarters]{.varname}, in the [Rows]{.uicontrol} area.

![Adding Invoice Date automatically generates the Quarters and Years fields.](images/pivots/invoices-pivot-datefields.png){#fig-invoices-pivot-datefields}

In the PivotTable (@fig-invoices-sales-grouped), sales are now grouped by year. This also shows that Brown started as a seller in 2011, not 2010, which could explain the lower amounts.

![Sales per seller per product category, grouped by year.](images/pivots/invoices-sales-grouped.png){#fig-invoices-sales-grouped}

6.  Click the [+]{.uicontrol} (plus) button next to any seller for the year 2010. This will expand the year to quarters for all sellers.

7.  Click the [+]{.uicontrol} (plus) button for Q1 next to any seller. As a result, the quarter will unfold to months for all sellers.

![Expanded levels for the year 2010 and Quarter 1.](images/pivots/invoices-pivot-drilldown.png){#fig-invoices-pivot-drilldown}

8.  Experiment with unfolding and folding levels again.

9.  Drag the [ProductCategory]{.varname} field out of the [Columns]{.uicontrol} box. Drag the [Quarters]{.varname} field from [Rows]{.uicontrol} to [Columns]{.uicontrol}, and drag the [Years]{.varname} and [InvoiceDate]{.varname} fields out of [Rows]{.uicontrol}. The design will now look like @fig-invoices-pivot-quarters. The result can be seen in @fig-invoices-sales-salesman-quarter.

![PivotTable design for sales per salesperson per quarter.](images/pivots/invoices-pivot-quarters.png){#fig-invoices-pivot-quarters}

![Sales per salesperson per quarter.](images/pivots/invoices-sales-salesman-quarter.png){#fig-invoices-sales-salesman-quarter}

To easily compare values, you can also choose to display percentages (of row total, column total, or grand total).

10. Select a numeric value in the PivotTable and choose [tab PivotTable Analyze \> Field Settings (Active Field group)]{.uicontrol}. In the dialog box, select the [Show Values As]{.uicontrol} tab and choose [% of Row Total]{.uicontrol}.

![Setting values to display as percentages of the row total.](images/pivots/invoices-fieldsettings-pct-rowtotal.png){#fig-invoices-fieldsettings-pct-rowtotal}

11. Click [OK]{.uicontrol}.

![Percentage of sales per salesperson per quarter.](images/pivots/invoices-sales-salesman-quarter-pct.png){#fig-invoices-sales-salesman-quarter-pct}

12, Then display the values as [% of Column Total]{.uicontrol}.

**Questions**

Use the PivotTable capabilities to answer the following questions. There are multiple ways to find the answers.

1.  Which seller sold the most in December 2010?

::: {.content-visible when-format="html:js"}
Seller `r mcq(c("Anderson","Brown", "Gonzalez", "Hernandez", "Johnson", "King", "Lewis", "Miller", answer="Phillips", "Smith", "Williams"))`
:::

2.  In which month of which year were software sales the highest?

::: {.content-visible when-format="html:js"}
Year `r mcq(c(2010, answer=2011))` Month `r mcq(c(answer="jan", "feb", "mat", "apr", "may", "jun", "jul", "aug", "sep", "oct", "nov", "dec"))`
:::

3.  View hardware and software sales percentages by region. What is the percentage for software in the South region?

::: {.content-visible when-format="html:js"}
Rounded to a whole number: `r fitb(answer = c(46, 47), num=TRUE)`
:::

4.  In what quarter of what year were Anderson's sales lowest?

::: {.content-visible when-format="html:js"}
Year `r mcq(c(2010, answer=2011))` Quarter `r mcq(c(1, 2, answer=3, 4))`
:::

5.  Check out Brown's sales in Q2 2011. Do you notice anything special?

::: {.content-visible when-format="html:js"}
`r hide("Answer")` Only revenue in the month of June. Nothing in April and May. `r unhide()`
:::

## Filtering {#sec-pivots-filters}

To filter data in a PivotTable, you can place one or more fields in the [Filters]{.uicontrol} box in the task pane. However, when filtering on multiple items, it can be difficult to see what you are filtering on.

A more user-friendly way is to use slicers. These contain several buttons that allow you to quickly filter data in a PivotTable. For filtering time data specifically, you can also use **timelines**, which are similar to slicers.

Slicers and timelines are often used in **dashboards** because they can be linked to multiple PivotTables and PivotCharts.

Three subtasks discuss creating report filters, slicers, and timelines. The file `Supermarket.xlsx` is used for this, the same file as in @sec-pivots-creating, which contains the monthly sales data in 2016 for several products, classified into three product groups: PVF (potatoes, vegetables, and fruits), meat, and dairy.

### Report filters {#sec-pivots-reportfilters}

:::: {#prp-pivots-reportfilters}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `Supermarket.xlsx`

1.  Open the file.

2.  Insert a PivotTable for the data on a new worksheet.

3.  Place the [productcategory]{.varname} field in [Columns]{.uicontrol}, the [sales]{.varname} field in [Values]{.uicontrol}, and the [date]{.varname} field in [Rows]{.uicontrol}.

::: callout-note
Excel's automatic time grouping adds the calculated field [Months]{.varname} to [Rows]{.uicontrol}. No other fields like quarters and years are added because all dates are only the last day of the month within a single year.
:::

4.  Drag the [date]{.varname} field from [Rows]{.uicontrol} so that only the [Months]{.varname} field is shown.

5.  Place the [town]{.varname} field in the [Filters]{.uicontrol} box. This will create a report filter in the PivotTable.

![PivotTable report with a filter for town (default showing all values).](images/pivots/supermarket-reportfilter-all.png){#fig-supermarket-reportfilter-all}

6.  Click the drop-down arrow and select "Amsterdam".

![PivotTable report with data filtered for Amsterdam (filter symbol indicates active filter).](images/pivots/supermarket-reportfilter-amsterdam.png){#fig-supermarket-reportfilter-amsterdam}

7.  Click the drop-down arrow, check the [Select Multiple Items]{.uicontrol} box, and then select "Amsterdam" and "Rotterdam".

The data for both towns will be displayed. Unfortunately, the filter only indicates that multiple items are selected, but not which specific items. For this scenario, slicers are a better alternative.

![PivotTable report with data filtered for multiple towns (specific towns visible via selection arrow).](images/pivots/supermarket-reportfilter-multiple.png){#fig-supermarket-reportfilter-multiple}

8.  Click the drop-down arrow and re-select the [(All)]{.uicontrol} option.

9.  Remove the [town]{.varname} field from the [Filters]{.uicontrol} box.
::::

### Slicers {#sec-pivots-slicers}

::: {#prp-pivots-slicers}
Continue with the file from @prp-pivots-reportfilters.

1.  Right-click on the [town]{.varname} field in the PivotTable field list and select [Add as Slicer]{.uicontrol}.

A slicer will be created in the worksheet.

![Slicer for the 'town' field.](images/pivots/supermarket-slicer-town.png){#fig-supermarket-slicer-town}

2.  Experiment with the slicer by selecting an item. You can select multiple items by holding down the [Ctrl]{.uicontrol} key or by using the ![Button for selecting multiple items.](images/pivots/slicer-button-multiple-items.png) button.

Another way to create slicers is through the menu. This method allows you to add multiple slicers at once.

3.  Click anywhere in the PivotTable report and choose [tab PivotTable Analyze \> Insert Slicer (Filter group)]{.uicontrol}.

![Insert Slicers dialog box.](images/pivots/slicer-insert-dialogbox.png){#fig-slicer-insert-dialogbox}

4.  Select [Months]{.varname} and click [OK]{.uicontrol}.

With the [Slicer]{.uicontrol} tab on the ribbon, you can format a slicer, such as changing its appearance, settings, colors, etc.

5.  Experiment with filtering the data using the two slicers.

6.  Delete all slicers by first selecting a slicer and then pressing the [Delete]{.uicontrol} key.
:::

### Timelines {#sec-pivots-timelines}

Timelines are similar to slicers. They also allow you to filter data, but they are specifically designed for use with date/time fields. The dates appear in a horizontal line from oldest to newest as you move from left to right on the timeline.

:::: {#prp-pivots-timelines}
Continue with the file from @prp-pivots-slicers.

1.  Click anywhere in the PivotTable report and choose [tab PivotTable Analyze \> Insert Timeline (Filter group)]{.uicontrol}.

The Insert Timeline dialog box only shows the [date]{.varname} field because it is the only date/time field.

2.  Select [date]{.varname} and click [OK]{.uicontrol}.

::: callout-note
![Timeline for the 'date' field.](images/pivots/supermarket-timeline-months.png){#fig-supermarket-timeline-months}

-   A scroll bar for the visible period.
-   Handles to select the period to filter on.
-   Choice of the time period to be displayed (Years, Quarters, Months, Days).
-   When you select a timeline, handles appear on the edges, allowing you to resize the area.
:::

3.  Select some months to see the results.

4.  Click on the period selector in the upper right corner and select [Quarters]{.uicontrol}.

![Timeline displaying quarters.](images/pivots/supermarket-timeline-quarters.png){#fig-supermarket-timeline-quarters}

5.  Select some quarters to see the results.

6.  Delete the timeline by selecting it and then pressing the [Delete]{.uicontrol} key.
::::

## Pivot Charts {#sec-pivots-charts}

A PivotChart displays data series, categories, and chart axes in the same way a standard chart does. However, it also provides interactive filtering, allowing you to quickly analyze a subset of your data. You can also use slicers for filtering data in a PivotChart.

::: {#prp-pivots-charts}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `Sales.xlsx`

1.  Open the file.

2.  Select the [PivotTable]{.varname} worksheet and then select any cell in the PivotTable on this worksheet.

3.  Choose [tab Insert \> PivotChart (Charts group) \> Clustered Column \> OK]{.uicontrol}.

![Column chart, linked to a PivotTable.](images/pivots/sales-chart-clustered-column.png){#fig-sales-chart-clustered-column}

The PivotChart has filters for [Region]{.varname} and [Salesman]{.varname}. When you use a filter in the chart, the data in the PivotTable will also be filtered.

4.  Experiment with filtering by a salesman and observe the results. End by displaying the data for all salesmen.

5.  Add a slicer for [Month]{.varname} and experiment with it.
:::

## PivotTables Options {#sec-pivots-options}

There are various setting options for PivotTables. To access them, select any cell in a PivotTable and then choose [tab PivotTable Analyze \> Options (PivotTable group)]{.uicontrol}. You will find several setting options organized into tabs (see below).

![Layout & Format options for PivotTables.](images/pivots/pivottable-options-layout-format.png){#fig-pivottable-options-layout-format}
